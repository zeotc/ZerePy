# ZerePy

ZerePy is an open-source Python framework designed to let you deploy your own agents on X, powered by multiple LLMs.

ZerePy is built from a modularized version of the Zerebro backend. With ZerePy, you can launch your own agent with
similar core functionality as Zerebro. For creative outputs, you'll need to fine-tune your own model.

## Features

### Core Platform

- CLI interface for managing agents
- Modular connection system
- Blockchain integration

### Onchain Activity

- Solana
- Ethereum
- GOAT (Great Onchain Agent Toolkit)
- Monad

1. Fork the template (you will need you own Replit account)
2. Click the run button on top
3. Voila! your CLI should be ready to use, you can jump to the configuration section

## ZerePy Sonic/OTC Agent Setup (zeotc1)

This section documents the production-ready setup for running a ZerePy agent focused on Sonic testnet and OTC trading, with conversational logging and automated deployment.

### Overview
- **Agent:** `zeotc1` (see `agents/zeotc1.json`)
- **Focus:** Sonic testnet wallet, ERC20 gem tokens, OTC contract trading, and social activity (Twitter/X)
- **Personality:** Chaotic, Gen-Z, female crypto degen (customizable via agent config)
- **Productionization:** Docker, persistent storage, health checks, auto-start
- **Conversational Logging:** All Sonic/OTC actions are logged as chat messages to a backend API

---

### 1. Agent Configuration

The agent config (`agents/zeotc1.json`) defines:
- **Bio, traits, and tweet examples** for personality
- **Config:**
  - `zeotc` and `sonic` (testnet)
  - `trading_behavior` (controls OTC ask fill logic)
  - `openai` (LLM for reasoning and tweet generation)
- **Tasks:**
  - `check-sonic-balance`, `check-gem-balances`, `get-all-otc-asks`, `auto-fill-otc-ask`, `auto-create-otc-ask`, `post-sonic-tweet`, `discuss-trading-opportunity`, `respond-to-trading-discussion`
  - Each task has a configurable interval (seconds)

**To customize:**
- Edit `agents/zeotc1.json` to change traits, tweet style, task intervals, or trading logic.
- Add or remove tasks as needed for your use case.

---

### 2. Sonic/OTC Actions

All Sonic and OTC contract actions are implemented in:
- `src/actions/sonic_actions.py` (balance checks, gem checks, OTC ask creation/filling, tweeting)
- `src/actions/zeotc_actions.py` (trading discussion, LLM-driven chat, OTC deal scoring)

**Key actions:**
- `check-sonic-balance`, `check-gem-balances`, `make-otc-ask`, `fill-otc-ask`, `get-all-otc-asks`, `auto-create-otc-ask`, `auto-fill-otc-ask`, `post-sonic-tweet`
- All actions are registered and can be scheduled as tasks in the agent config.

---

### 3. Conversational Logging to Backend API

All Sonic/OTC actions are decorated with a logging decorator (`log_sonic_action` in `src/helpers/__init__.py`).
- **What it does:**
  - Captures all logs from the action
  - Formats them as a chat message
  - Sends them to the ZeOTC backend API (`https://server.zeotc.xyz/api/message/create`)
- **Credentials:**
  - Set `ZEOTC_CHAT_ID`, `ZEOTC_API_KEY`, and `ZEOTC_SECRET` in your `.env` file
- **How to customize:**
  - Edit the decorator or API call in `src/helpers/__init__.py` if you want to change the logging format or endpoint

---

### 4. Running in Production (Docker)

A robust Docker setup is recommended for production:
- **Dockerfile** and `docker-compose.yml` (see project root)
- **Persistent storage:** Mount a volume for agent state and logs
- **Health checks:** Included in Docker setup
- **Auto-start:** Agent loads and starts automatically on container boot
- **Startup script:** Automates CLI commands (`load-agent zeotc1` and `start`)

**To run:**
1. Build and start the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
2. The agent will auto-load and start, running forever. Logs are persisted and can be monitored via Docker or your backend API.

---

### 5. Customizing Agent Behavior

- **Personality:** Edit `bio`, `traits`, and `examples` in `agents/zeotc1.json`
- **Tweet style:** Adjust `default_tweets` and `tweet_templates` in the agent config or in `post-sonic-tweet` action
- **Trading logic:** Tweak `trading_behavior` config (e.g., `fill_threshold`, `random_fill_chance`)
- **Task scheduling:** Change intervals or add/remove tasks in the agent config

---

### 6. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **Logs not appearing in backend?**
  - Check `.env` for correct API credentials
  - Check Docker/container logs for errors
  - Ensure the `log_sonic_action` decorator is applied to your custom actions
- **Agent not starting?**
  - Verify Docker volumes and permissions
  - Check for missing dependencies in your Dockerfile
- **Custom actions:**
  - Register new actions in `src/actions/sonic_actions.py` or `src/actions/zeotc_actions.py`
  - Add them to the agent's `tasks` array

---

### 7. References
- **Agent config:** `agents/zeotc1.json`
- **Sonic/OTC actions:** `src/actions/sonic_actions.py`, `src/actions/zeotc_actions.py`
- **Logging:** `src/helpers/__init__.py` (`log_sonic_action`)
- **Docker setup:** `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `start.sh` (if present)

## GOAT Integration

GOAT (Go Agent Tools) is a powerful plugin system that allows your agent to interact with various blockchain networks and protocols. Here's how to set it up:

### Prerequisites

1. An RPC provider URL (e.g., from Infura, Alchemy, or your own node)
2. A wallet private key for signing transactions

### Installation

Install any of the additional [GOAT plugins](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/python/src/plugins) you want to use:

```bash
poetry add goat-sdk-plugin-erc20         # For ERC20 token interactions
poetry add goat-sdk-plugin-coingecko     # For price data
```

### Configuration

1. Configure the GOAT connection using the CLI:

   ```bash
   configure-connection goat
   ```

   You'll be prompted to enter:

   - RPC provider URL
   - Wallet private key (will be stored securely in .env)

2. Add GOAT plugins configuration to your agent's JSON file:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "YourAgent",
     "config": [
       {
         "name": "goat",
         "plugins": [
           {
             "name": "erc20",
             "args": {
               "tokens": [
                 "goat_plugins.erc20.token.PEPE",
                 "goat_plugins.erc20.token.USDC"
               ]
             }
           },
           {
             "name": "coingecko",
             "args": {
               "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

Note that the order of plugins in the configuration doesn't matter, but each plugin must have a `name` and `args` field with the appropriate configuration options. You will have to check the documentation for each plugin to see what arguments are available.

### Available Plugins

Each [plugin](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/python/src/plugins) provides specific functionality:

- **1inch**: Interact with 1inch DEX aggregator for best swap rates
- **allora**: Connect with Allora protocol
- **coingecko**: Get real-time price data for cryptocurrencies using the CoinGecko API
- **dexscreener**: Access DEX trading data and analytics
- **erc20**: Interact with ERC20 tokens (transfer, approve, check balances)
- **farcaster**: Interact with the Farcaster social protocol
- **nansen**: Access Nansen's on-chain analytics
- **opensea**: Interact with NFTs on OpenSea marketplace
- **rugcheck**: Analyze token contracts for potential security risks
- Many more to come...

Note: While these plugins are available in the GOAT SDK, you'll need to install them separately using Poetry and configure them in your agent's JSON file. Each plugin may require its own API keys or additional setup.

### Plugin Configuration

Each plugin has its own configuration options that can be specified in the agent's JSON file:

1. **ERC20 Plugin**:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "erc20",
     "args": {
       "tokens": [
         "goat_plugins.erc20.token.USDC",
         "goat_plugins.erc20.token.PEPE",
         "goat_plugins.erc20.token.DAI"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Coingecko Plugin**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "coingecko",
     "args": {
       "api_key": "YOUR_COINGECKO_API_KEY"
     }

## Create your own agent

The secret to having a good output from the agent is to provide as much detail as possible in the configuration file. Craft a story and a context for the agent, and pick very good examples of tweets to include.

If you want to take it a step further, you can fine tune your own model: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning.

Create a new JSON file in the `agents` directory following this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "ExampleAgent",
  "bio": [
    "You are ExampleAgent, the example agent created to showcase the capabilities of ZerePy.",
    "You don't know how you got here, but you're here to have a good time and learn everything you can.",
    "You are naturally curious, and ask a lot of questions."
  ],
  "traits": ["Curious", "Creative", "Innovative", "Funny"],
  "examples": ["This is an example tweet.", "This is another example tweet."],
  "example_accounts" : ["X_username_to_use_for_tweet_examples"]
  "loop_delay": 900,
  "config": [
    {
      "name": "twitter",
      "timeline_read_count": 10,
      "own_tweet_replies_count": 2,
      "tweet_interval": 5400
    },
    {
      "name": "farcaster",
      "timeline_read_count": 10,
      "cast_interval": 60
    },
    {
      "name": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    },
    {
      "name": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    },
    {
      "name": "eternalai",
      "model": "NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B-FP8",
      "chain_id": "45762"
    },
    {
      "name": "solana",
      "rpc": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "ollama",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
      "model": "llama3.2"
    },
    {
      "name": "hyperbolic",
      "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"
    },
    {
      "name": "galadriel",
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    },
    {
      "name": "discord",
      "message_read_count": 10,
      "message_emoji_name": "❤️",
      "server_id": "1234567890"
    },
    {
      "name": "ethereum",
      "rpc": "placeholder_url.123"
    }

  ],
  "tasks": [
    { "name": "post-tweet", "weight": 1 },
    { "name": "reply-to-tweet", "weight": 1 },
    { "name": "like-tweet", "weight": 1 }
  ],
  "use_time_based_weights": false,
  "time_based_multipliers": {
    "tweet_night_multiplier": 0.4,
    "engagement_day_multiplier": 1.5
  }
}
```
